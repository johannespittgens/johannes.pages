    <h1>What to visit in Milan? Top 5 things to see in Milan</h1>
    <p>I’ve had the honour to visit Milan in April 2022. Milan is one of the most dazzling fashion capitals in the world, but also boasts numerous impressive sights and world-class art. You get the chance to walk in the footsteps of Leonardo da Vinci or Napoleon and let yourself be fascinated by this vibrant city. I’ve collected my list of the top 10 Milan sights that will give you an insight into the legendary world of Milan. If you guarantee you exciting insights that will make you want to visit this beautiful Italian metropolis even more.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Why did I create this list?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I believe something is fundamentally wrong with all these websites that show you the &ldquo;top 10 things to see in [insert city name]&rdquo;
        <ul>
        <li>could add an image here of these website and cross them out</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We search for sights + places to visit not in the tools that we use to navigate the city - this is a pain point I&rsquo;ve felt in my last minute preparations for this trip:
        <ul>
        <li>First, I looked up the &ldquo;top 10 things to do in Milan&rdquo; before travelling there. Those sights were described on a website, they had lots of affiliate links directing me to purchase tickets for a tour or museum, but they didn&rsquo;t show up on a map that I could use to navigate around the city. So I went ahead and added those sights to my Google Maps list &ldquo;Milan&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Secondly, I asked local friends which I had met at university for their recommendations on restaurants and bars. They sent me their responses via Whatsapp - shoutout to you friends, I was very grateful for those. But I had the same issue here: I had a long list of recommendations without any information on where they were, what they offered, their prices, etc. Again, I added those to a Google Maps list so I could easily combine my sightseeing with their food recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>How should you use these recommendations?</h2>
    <p>My recommendation is to download Google Maps to your phone (if you haven’t already) and then start exploring the city by using <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DMfWqvN1Hp8JXii2A">my list on Google Maps</a>.</p>

    <h3>Sempione Park</h3>
        <p>Just behind Castello Sforzesco and adjacent to the trendy Brera district, the park was designed in the late 19th century. The grounds include a gravel road, the Arch of Peace (Arco della Pace), a lake and even a small arena Shibika used for concerts and sporting events. The park's Torre Blanca Tower overlooks the entire city. The museums in the park include the Triennale Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Palazzo dell'arte, as well as a small aquarium in the city.</p>
        <p>Sempione Park is one of the best places to take a relaxing walk or bike in Milan and is probably part of a walking or cycling tour of the city's attractions. On sunny weekends, many city dwellers relax in the park-and there's no reason you shouldn't do the same.</p>
